				<h2>Represent API</h2>
				<p>Represent matches a supporter's postal code or geocoded address to the correct elected officials. It makes it easy for you to build “email your representative” advocacy campaigns. During elections, we can connect your activists to political candidates.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Connect your supporters with their political representatives.</li>
					<li>Provide relevant information based on your user's electoral district.</li>
					<li>Map your potential voters, donors and volunteers to electoral ridings.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Represent is open source and makes its source data available where possible.</p>

				<h2>Open 511</h2>
				<h4>Standards</h4>
				<p>The open data movement has demonstrated its value to society on many occasions, particularly with recent efforts to improve information about transit systems. Following the example of other formats like GTFS, Open511 proposes a specification for road incident, construction and much more that matches open data criteria. With Open511, public bodies and citizens can get the most out of your jurisdiction’s data by turning your road events into powerful and innovative software and analysis.</p>

				<h4>Interoperable</h4>
				<p>By increasing access to your road event data, you're demonstrating a commitment to robust and transparent information. You will help organizations within your jurisdiction work together and, with the help of fellow adopters, gain access to data that will strengthen your own offerings.</p>

				<h4>Interjurisdiction Communication</h4>
				<p>With wide adoption of Open511, the headaches of sharing construction schedules, festival dates and daily road closures will slip away. Your communication teams will have easy to use cost-effective tools to share road events making their lives easier, and your organization look better.</p>

				<h4>Do-it-Yourself Open Data Toolkit</h4>
				<h5>What is the DIY Open Data Toolkit and Who is it Intended for?</h5>
				<p>The toolkit can be viewed as a collection of best practices and plans for initiating an open data project or program in a municipal setting.  Its content draws on Open North’s international and Canadian experience as well as best practices and advice shared by members of the project’s advisory group acknowledged above. The project was targeted for those municipalities who have not yet begun an open data project or project. It could also be beneficial to others considering open data including non-profits, provinces, agencies/boards/commissions as well as those already doing open data.</p>
				<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhWFBPMXGSzWUwHX-imDfQW8whQ_M7lX5ONbb9aHPc4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">DIY Toolkit</a></p>
				<h5>The Initial Project and Scope for Municipalities</h5>
				<p>The project supported by the Federal government is a pilot project intended to serve as a guideline and project plan for those municipalities that have not yet initiated open data in their organization. It is understood that each municipality will have varying capacities to undertake a pilot project so the toolkit provides options related to the different scopes.</p>

				<h4>International Open Data Charter: Case Studies</h4>
				<p>Forty six governments have adopted the Charter to date - these include seventeen national and thirty sub-national governments. The Charter team wants to have a better understanding of the benefits and challenges facing governments that want to use the Charter principles to implement open data programmes.<p>

				<h4>Benchmarking National and Local Government Open Data Programs</h4>
				<p>The overall project goal is to provide an open data assessment framework that can be used to monitor progress of open data implementation at the ministerial and city levels of government.</p>
				<p>A second project goal is to pilot two assessments using the assessment framework created; one for ministries, one for cities.</p>
				<p>The value in this project is the creation of a methodology with a set of feedback loops that can be self-administered and remain relevant to Ukraine’s governance. This project will enable comparison of individual ministries, agencies or departments within government. Individual ministries will benefit from a standardized assessment and framework; they will be able to review the effectiveness of their efforts over time and share successes amongst one another. Ultimately, the improvement of open data operations throughout the Government of Ukraine will benefit citizens, civil society, businesses, academia, and other stakeholders.</p>

				<h4>Accelerating Open Data in York Region</h4>
				<p>The project goal is to provide York Region with the necessary open data program review and roadmap/strategic planning to enable them to become an open data leader in Canada. The value of such an undertaking will be to enhance benefits to all its open data stakeholders both internally and externally. The current benefits of its open data program can be expanded in areas of internal efficiencies in operations and service delivery, external enhancements to their potential economic development environment and enhanced social benefits to the community at large. These benefits can be enhanced with closer coordination, communication, and collaboration on open data among York Region’s 9 municipalities and lead to increased interoperability, data literacy and collaboration opportunities. The activities described in this proposal are designed with this long term regional vision in mind.</p>

				<h4>Multi-stakeholder forum</h4>
				<p>The Multi-Stakeholder Forum aims to advance constructive, ongoing dialogue on open government between the Government of Canada and non-government stakeholders.</p>
				<p>Establishing a permanent forum for dialogue provides a formal structure for regular, two-way communication between the Government and its key open government stakeholders. This process is designed to achieve real gains in transparency, accountability, and participation.</p>
				<p>The Multi-stakeholder Forum (“Forum”) is a regular meeting of stakeholders and government representatives to promote government-stakeholder dialogue on open government policies, with a focus on the development, implementation and assessment of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Forum will be consultative, with a focus on consensus building, collective action and co-creation.  Informed by accordance with OGP Participation and Co-creation standards, this dialogue mechanism is expected to evolve and deepen collaboration with Forum members and other committed stakeholders.</p>

				<h2>Citizen Budget</h2>
				<p>Unlike a regular survey or a budget visualization software, Citizen Budget is an interactive platform that shows the financial impacts of participants' choices in real time, educating them about the trade-offs and constraints faced by their municipality. Our user-friendly and fun budget exercise creates a two-way dialogue between you and your community, providing both parties with rich and detailed information. Your residents can conveniently access your online budget consultation anytime and at their own pace, making it a clear improvement over public meetings which involve travel, time, childminding and other accessibility constraints.	Over 80 cities in North America, and deployed internationally (Kiev, elsewhere?)</p>
