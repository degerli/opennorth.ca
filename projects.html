				<h2>Standardizing Open Smart City Guidelines</h2>
				<h5>Jan 2017 - Mar 2018<br />
				Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), GeoConnections Program</h5>
				<p>In collaboration with leading researchers and Canadian smart cities, as well as provinces with advanced open government programs, this project will develop municipal data management policies and guidelines that connect open data and smart cities programmes and ensure the two support one another. With a focus on interoperability and interjurisdictional coordination, this project supports capacity building and knowledge exchange. There are five milestones:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Gap analysis of open data standards</strong> in smart cities. The report identifies the actors that define smart cities, how new technology procurement furthers smart city goals, and how ideas of transparency and accessibility translate to smart city policy and practice. </li>
					<li><strong>Assessment of Canadian smart cities.</strong> In depth city profiles were developed as a result of interviews with city officials implementing smart cities from the cities of Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, and Guelph. </li>
					<li><strong>Review of international open smart city best practices</strong> (e.g. Chicago, New York, Helsinki and Dublin). The results of this extensive review will be presented during a <a href="https://gts-ee.webex.com/mw3000/mywebex/default.do?nomenu=true&siteurl=gts-ee&service=6&rnd=0.5061904226146657&main_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgts-ee.webex.com%2Fec3000%2Feventcenter%2Fevent%2FeventAction.do%3FtheAction%3Ddetail%26%26%26EMK%3D4832534b00000004c4cb2c4a5cb8f301570a9fa456fbe9d0c900378cce1c128d3ee9841c97de61ba%26siteurl%3Dgts-ee%26confViewID%3D3013357556%26encryptTicket%3DSDJTSwAAAARSGsYUzbnp5OlrUS0VvcsEUN3mwAkyUt-MTTNs_9t66Q2%26" target="_blank">webinar on August 30th</a>. See <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/2017/08/14/situating-canadian-cities-within-an-international-smart-city-ecosystem.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Provincial case study.</strong> To situate open smart city policies and data management practices in Canada’s inter-jurisdictional context, OpenNorth will conduct in-depth interviews with the Province of Ontario and consult with the Province of British Columbia. </li>
					<li><strong>Data management policies and guidelines.</strong> This final phase of the project will be developed in close consultation with municipal and provincial partners. Results will be disseminated broadly.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>OpenNorth is also part of a separate GeoConnections project which is developing a Geospatial Decision Support Platform (GDSP) for municipalities. This platform differentiates itself from MASAS national emergency management system (EMS) by providing a decision support system to facilitate the everyday business of a city by de-siloing data on a city-wide shared platform. OpenNorth is working with geospatial data managers from the cities of Toronto, Vancouver, and Niagara on data requirements and availability.</p>

				<h2>Open Data Strategic Planning and Roadmapping</h2>
				<h5>Jul 2017 - Dec 2017<br />
				City of Toronto</h5>
				<p>OpenNorth is currently working with the City of Toronto’s open data team to design and coordinate an internal and external multi-stakeholder engagement process culminating in the city’s open data master plan and implementation roadmap. OpenNorth developed a <strong>thematic, focused cluster engagement model</strong> on city <strong>resilience</strong> and <strong>smart city</strong> issues to identify the value added of open data with targeted stakeholders. See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8BZxtR6WDBJcHYzallaZFNBRFU/view" target="_blank">publication on urban resilience</a>. The City’s master plan and roadmap framework are based on best practices from leading international examples and open data maturity models based on the Open Data Charter. OpenNorth is creating an <strong>advisory group</strong> of local open data community leaders to inform its mandate, and deploying a range of <strong>online tools</strong> (e.g. survey, <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com/" target="_blank">resource allocation simulator</a>, collective deliberation platform) to meaningfully engage a range and diversity stakeholders. This project is also being documented to scale.</p>

				<h2>Aligning Local Open Data Programs with International Best Practices</h2>
				<h5>Jan 2017 - Ongoing<br />
				Open Data Charter Secretariat</h5>
				<p>The Government of Canada was among the key global partners that led the creation of the Open Data Charter (ODC) in 2015. More than 50 governments have adopted the ODC to date, including the City of Edmonton and the Province of Ontario. As a Steward of the ODC, OpenNorth conducted a study in early 2017 to identify how local and provincial governments in Canada could <strong>align open data programs with ODS principles</strong> and its framework. See <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/2017/01/30/final-report-aligning-canadian-open-data-programs-with-international-best-practices.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. OpenNorth was since contracted by the Open Data Charter Secretariat to interview city managers, local civic leaders, and elected officials from 6 cities in Canada and 4 cities around the world (including, Buenos Aires, Mexico City) to identify <strong>adoption barriers, interests, future plans, and support needs</strong>.</p>

				<h2>Canada in the World: Towards Canadian-Led Open Government</h2>
				<h5>Jul 2017-October 2017<br />
				Powered by Data</h5>
				<p>In this project, we identified the opportunities for Canada to take a leadership role in the global open government movement, and expand the Federal Government's open government policy internationally. We position open government within the arena of foreign policy and as an alternative form of Canadian soft power. Six recommendations, based on the views of select Canadian open government experts, are provided as guidance for Canada's approach to its next three years as a member of the Open Government Partnership Steering Committee.</p>

				<h2>State of Open Data</h2>
				<h5>Aug 2017 - January 2019<br />
				International Development Research Center (IDRC)</h5>
				<p>OpenNorth was awarded a grant by IDRC for The State of Open Data: Reflecting on Its Role for Sustainable Development project to examine the <strong>maturity of the global open data movement</strong> leading up to the International Open Data Conference 2018. OpenNorth is part of the project’s steering group which will develop the research methodology, recruit leading international expert contributors, design <strong>specific interventions</strong> on topics of interest, and oversee the review and editorial process. Given its track record, OpenNorth is responsible for the <strong>cities section</strong> of the final publication, for which it will prototype its <strong>data driven problem framing and solutions development</strong> stakeholder engagement methodology.</p>

				<h2>Developing and Facilitating Multi-Stakeholder Data Governance Initiatives</h2>
				<h5>Jul 2017 - Mar 2018<br />
				Quartier des Spectacles (QdS), City of Montréal</h5>
				<p>Led by the Partenariat du Quartier des Spectacles, which coordinates engagement strategies and initiatives in Montreal’s foremost arts and entertainment district, OpenNorth is developing and facilitating a <strong>multi-stakeholder shared data governance</strong> working group with cultural industry stakeholders. The initiative includes all major cultural venues in the area, research institutions, and provincial government partners. The sharing governance model will include: <strong>data life cycle management</strong> procedures, joint data <strong>ontologies</strong> and <strong>standards</strong>, technical <strong>capacity building</strong>, a <strong>common policy framework</strong> and prototypes and <strong>tools</strong> to demonstrate the value added of shared data collaboration (e.g. market research and analysis, business development, data visualization). Building on our experience initiating the Province of Quebec’s <a href="https://www.donneesquebec.ca/fr/" target="_blank">multijurisdictional open data portal</a>, the QdS model is being documented to scale and funding is currently being sought to sustain and expand the ongoing Montreal initiative.</p>

				<h2>Scaling the Municipal Open Data Community</h2>
				<h5>Apr - Jun 2017<br />
				Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), Open Government Team</h5>
				<p>OpenNorth was contracted by TBS to develop a <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/blog/do-it-yourself-open-data-pilot-project-municipal-governments-now-underway" target="_blank">municipal Do-It-Yourself (DIY) open data toolkit</a> for Canadian cities that have yet to implement open data initiatives. The toolkit was developed in collaboration with <strong>15 Canadian cities</strong> of different sizes and capacity with advanced open data programs. The DIY provides program management guidelines and examples of documented benefits, <strong>roadmap and planning templates</strong>, use cases and check lists, and a <strong>comprehensive list of resources</strong> (i.e. standards, policies, risk analysis) to help municipalities begin opening their data and join the Canadian open data community. The DIY also gives advice on <strong>data stakeholder needs identification</strong> and sustainable <strong>engagement</strong> practices. Adapted for its specific audience, the toolkit also provides labour and cost estimates required for municipalities to start their own initiatives. OpenNorth is currently in discussion with different provincial governments to adapt, prototype, and deploy the DIY regionally as well as develop advanced versions of the DIY.</p>

				<h2>Benchmarking Local Government Open Data Programs</h2>
				<h5>Sep - Dec 2017<br />
				Eurasia Foundation</h5>
				<p>Drawing from its experience as a contributor to the Global Open Data Index and Open Data Barometer, OpenNorth is developing an <strong>open data assessment framework</strong> that can be used to <strong>monitor progress of open data implementation</strong> at the national, ministerial and city levels of government in Ukraine. The value in this project is the creation of a methodology with a set of <strong>feedback loops</strong> that can be self-administered and remain relevant to national and local governance. The standardized assessment and framework methodology will enable comparison of individual government institutions over time and <strong>facilitate the comprehensive documentation</strong> of improvement of <strong>open data operations</strong> throughout the Government of Ukraine at different levels.</p>

				<h2>From Development to Adoption: Lessons From Three Open Standards</h2>
				<h5>Sep 2017-Nov 2017<br />
				Open Data Institute</h5>
				<p>Developing and maintaining data standards is difficult, but a necessary step to unlock the potential for open data. To maximise the potential for widespread adoption, new standards initiatives must build upon the success and failure of existing standards. We document our own experiences with Popolo, Represent, and Open511 to share with the open data community.</p>
