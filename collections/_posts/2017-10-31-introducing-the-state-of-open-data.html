title: Introducing The State of Open Data
author: Stephen Walker, Tim Davies, Mor Rubinstein and Jean-No√© Landry
description: 2018 will mark 10 years of active and growing open data initiatives. From a political perspective, 10 years might be considered a moment in time, but from a technological point of a view, a decade may represent multiple generations of innovation. In the open data context, where tech and politics meet, we hope that a decade means that open data is no longer a buzzword, but rather a powerful tool to create positive social change all over the world.
