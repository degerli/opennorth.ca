testimonial: “Our partnership with OpenNorth to identify lessons from city pioneers worldwide in opening up data highlighted a number of important recommendations for officials to encourage trust in government, improve the provision of services, and stimulate economic growth. This work is a clear example of a crucial role they play globally in supporting governmental capacity to create the cities of the future.”

As Steward of the Open Data Charter, we supported the City of Edmonton in becoming the first city in Canada to adopt the Charter. Building on its participation in the international Charter Implementation Working Group, OpenNorth is advising the Province of Ontario in implementing the Charter as part of a multi-stakeholder working group and integrated the 6 Charter principles in the development of the City of Toronto’s open data master plan and roadmap and stakeholder engagement process. The Open Data Charter was founded in 2015 and updated in 2018 (with help from OpenNorth) and involves collaboration between governments and experts working to open up government data. More than 70 governments and organisations have joined the movement. OpenNorth’s study of how government open data policies and programs could align with the open data policies of cities and provinces in Canada helped document the potential for adoption of the Charter in Canada (see [report](http://public.citizenbudget.com/uploads/custom/on.ca/ODCinCanada.pdf "report")).
