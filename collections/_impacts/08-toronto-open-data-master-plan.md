testimonial: “I think the process that OpenNorth led was the beginning of a longer conversation about Toronto’s future of open data and open government. So the first impact of the plan would be the process got people talking and now, as the City of Toronto starts to implement, the plan provides clear strategic direction about next steps.”

We worked with the City of Toronto’s open data team to design and coordinate an internal and external multi-stakeholder engagement process culminating in the [City’s Open Data Master Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2018/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-110740.pdf) and implementation roadmap. Specific deliverables that had impact for the city included a thematic, focused cluster engagement model on [city resilience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B739vUevKlPgYjJweC1NMElDaVk/view) and smart city issues to identify the value added of open data with targeted stakeholders. The City’s Master Plan and Roadmap are based on best practices from leading international examples and open data maturity models based on the Open Data Charter. We continue this work in helping the City of Montreal to develop their own plan, and through our new programs to support government strategic planning capacity locally and globally.
