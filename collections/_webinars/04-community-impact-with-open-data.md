We partnered with our colleagues at the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/ "Sunlight Foundation") and discussed how to effect community impact with open data, sharing best practices and lessons learned from our experiences working with cities. Through our [development of the do-it-yourself open data toolkit](https://open.canada.ca/en/toolkit/diy "Do-It-Yourself Open Data Toolkit") and [our cluster model approach](/our-offer "Open North - Our Offer"), which posits problem framing as the key to effective engagement around data, change in cities is a community effort. However daunting, city staff need to incorporate resident feedback in their data-driven work and support residents in their own use of open data. We discussed how city staff can recognize fears around data and its use by the public, understand the powerful potential of public participation in data-driven problems solving, and nurture that potential to create a robust, enduring open data program.
