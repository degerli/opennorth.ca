As Canadian municipalities pursue developing and deploying open and smart city strategies and roadmaps it is suggested in this webinar that there are tools, practices, policies and legislation that can inform and assist public officials in decision making about the deployment of open smart cities and also about the processes and procedures that enable the dissemination of data generated in smart city contexts and about the technologies that are used to generate those data. Findings from this webinar are particularly timely due to the recent launch of Infrastructure Canada’s [Smart Cities Challenge](http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/cities-villes-eng.html).
