In this webinar we present a first ever definition for an Open Smart City and the Open Smart Cities Guide V1.0, informed by research conducted in Canada and an examination of international best practices. In the context of Canada’s Smart Cities Challenge and the public conversation regarding Sidewalk Labs, this webinar gave us timely opportunity to receive public feedback on the definition and structure of our guide. The webinar refers to tools, practices, policies, recommendations and legal frameworks to guide Canadian municipalities toward co-creating Open Smart Cities with their residents. Video recording of the webinar presentation available [here](https://vimeo.com/265436607).
