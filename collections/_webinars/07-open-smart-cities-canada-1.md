As Canadian municipalities trend towards developing and deploying open and smart city strategies and roadmaps, they must increasingly become aware of tools, processes and procedures that produce open and geospatial data and determine the priority data that will become public and contribute to smart city contexts. OpenNorth’s Open Smart Cities in Canada project is funded by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and consists of an environmental-scan (E-scan) and gap analysis of smart city definitions, actors, standards and pathways; a Canadian smart cities assessment report from the project’s four partnering cities (Edmonton, Montreal, Guelph and Ottawa); an inter-jurisdictional framework based on a case study in the Province of Ontario; a report on international policy mobilities and guidelines for city manager practices surrounding open and geospatial data in a smart city context.
