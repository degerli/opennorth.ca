Conducted in 2017, this follow-up research project conducted for Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada (IRCC) was designed to gain a deeper understanding of the digital capacity and needs of service provider organizations that serve newcomers in Canada and inform support recommendations for the sector. OpenNorth collects the input of 261 newcomer settlement organizations with a primary data collection tool and presents its findings in a French and English webinar.
