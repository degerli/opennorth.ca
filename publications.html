			January 2017</h5>
			<p>The international Open Data Charter (ODC) is a set of 6 principles that provide governments with a common foundation upon which to realise the full potential of open data. As Steward of the ODC, OpenNorth interviewed 10 cities and 4 provinces in Canada to discuss how the ODC could align with sub-national open data policies and programs. The report is a collaboration with Geothink.ca. The City of Edmonton was Canada’s first city to subsequently adopt the ODC and OpenNorth currently advises the Province of Ontario on the ODC’s implementation.</p>

			<h5>Authors: Rachel Bloom (OpenNorth), Dr Tracey Lauriault (Carleton University), Jean-Noé Landry (OpenNorth)<br />
			Funded by Natural Resources Canada<br />
			August 2017</h5>
			<p>As Canadian municipalities trend towards developing and deploying open and smart city strategies and roadmaps, they must increasingly become aware of tools, processes and procedures that produce open and geospatial data and determine the priority data that will become public and contribute to smart city contexts. OpenNorth’s Open Smart Cities in Canada project is funded by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and consists of an environmental-scan (E-scan) and gap analysis of smart city definitions, actors, standards, and pathways; a Canadian smart cities assessment report from the project’s four partnering cities (Edmonton, Montreal, Guelph, and Ottawa); an inter-jurisdictional framework based on a case study in the Province of Ontario; a report on international policy mobilities and guidelines for city manager practices surrounding open and geospatial data in a smart city context.</p>
			<p>This research is led by OpenNorth and funded by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) GeoConnections. The core team of experts leading the research for this project include Prof. Tracey Lauriault at Carleton University, M. David Fewer at the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC), and Prof. Mark S. Fox at the University of Toronto.</p>

			<h5>Authors: Paulina Marczak (Queen's University, former OpenNorth research intern), Renée Sieber (McGill University, Geothink Lead)<br/>
			September 2017</h5>
			<p>Legislatures are increasingly attuned to the rhetoric of open data for legislative content like bills and Hansards. This rhetoric dictates that government content should be freely accessible, repurposable, machine-readable, standardized across subregions, and available without licensing restrictions. Canada offers an excellent example of renewed emphasis on openness across jurisdictions. The call for legislative openness also derives from open data advocates, who seek to apply the rules of open data to unstructured information. We do not know whether legislative openness in Canada, at the provincial and territorial level, matches the rhetoric of open data. This study focused on commonly occurring categories of information on subnational legislative websites, and examined their copyright, availability, archivability, information timeliness, and plain language descriptions.</p>

			<h5>Authors: Rachel Bloom (OpenNorth), Dr Tracey Lauriault (Carleton University), Jean-Noé Landry (OpenNorth)<br />
			Funded by Natural Resources Canada<br />
			December 2017</h5>
			<p>As Canadian municipalities pursue developing and deploying open and smart city strategies and roadmaps it is suggested in this webinar that there are tools, practices, policies and legislation that can inform and assist public officials in decision making about the deployment of open smart cities and also about the processes and procedures that enable the dissemination of data generated in smart city contexts and about the technologies that are used to generate those data. Findings from this webinar are particularly timely due to the recent launch of Infrastructure Canada’s <a href="http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/cities-villes-eng.html" target="_blank">Smart Cities Challenge</a>.</p>

			<h5>Authored by OpenNorth<br />
			Funded by Open Data Institute (ODI)<br />
			December 2017</h5>
			<p>Developing and maintaining data standards is difficult, but a necessary step to unlock the potential for open data. To maximise the potential for widespread adoption, new standards initiatives must build upon the success and failure of existing standards. We document our own experiences with Open511, Popolo and Represent to share with the open data community.</p>

			<h5>Authored by OpenNorth and Powered by Data<br />
			Funded by OpenNorth and Powered by Data<br />
			November 2017</h5>
			<p>In collaboration with Powered by Data, OpenNorth identified the opportunities for Canada to take a leadership role in the global open government movement, and expand the Federal Government's open government policy internationally. We position open government within the arena of foreign policy and as an alternative form of Canadian soft power. Based on the views of 13 Canadian open government experts, the following 6 themes provide guidance for Canada's leadership role as a member of the Open Government Partnership Steering Committee:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Lead by Example</li>
				<li>Active and Proactive Participation by Politicians and Civil Servants at all Levels</li>
				<li>Clarify the Message</li>
				<li>Go Beyond Compliance</li>
				<li>Translate Open Government to Other Policy Areas</li>
				<li>Reinforce the Relationship with Canadian Civil Society Organisations</li>

			<h5>Authors: Tracey P. Lauriault, Rachel Bloom, Carly Livingstone, Jean-Noé Landry<br />
			Funded by Natural Resources Canada's GeoConnections Program<br />
			Spring 2018</h5>
			<p>This executive summary consolidates findings from a smart city environmental scan (E-Scan) and five case studies of smart city initiatives in Canada. The E-Scan included examining documents and definitions produced by smart city vendors, think tanks, associations, consulting firms, standards organizations, conferences, civil society organizations, including critical academic literature, government reports, marketing material, specifications and requirements documents. This research was motivated by a desire to identify international shapers of smart cities and to better understand what differentiates a smart city from an Open Smart City.</p>

			<h5>Acknowledgements<br>
				This project was funded by the J.W. McConnell Foundation. In addition to the J.W. McConnell Foundation, we would like to thank the following for their valuable input: Social Innovation Exchange (SIX), Community Safety Knowledge Alliance (CSKA), the Government of Saskatchewan (Ministry of Justice, Community Safety & Wellbeing), the Yorkton Hub, and the Prince Albert Centre of Responsibility.
			</h5>
			<p>The Province of Saskatchewan’s Hub model is a strong example of a cross-jurisdictional, cross-sectoral, integrated service delivery model that is changing the way human services are delivered to the public. Through its highly flexible--but privacy-conscious--structure, Hubs in Saskatchewan are bringing together service providers into collaborative settings and building relationships. In this model, service providers collaborate, share data, and address common problems. Our investigation of the Hub is aimed at documenting its functioning and investigating perceptions surrounding it and the potential role of philanthropy.</p>
