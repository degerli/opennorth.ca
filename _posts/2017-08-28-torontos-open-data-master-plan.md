Drawing on our strategic planning, maturity modelling, and stakeholder engagement expertise, OpenNorth is supporting the City of Toronto in developing its [Open Data Master Plan](http://opennorth.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a602fac79ef3dc584bf1a2743&id=cc3fd2708b&e=27491208ab), and we're going about this in a very engaging and collaborative way.

Through an iterative series of in-person and online consultations, we will be soliciting feedback from a broad range of internal and external stakeholders—including the public—to ensure our Open Data Master Plan and Roadmap is in support of the City's commitment to Open Government and guided by our four principles:

1. Co-developed with the public;
2. Focus on releasing data sets that help solve civic issues and provide highest public benefit;
3. Explore opportunities to improve City efficiency; and
4. Embrace inclusivity to remove barriers to open data and strengthen resilience.
